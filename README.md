Policy Gradient methods implemented using Torch


This project implements some Reinforcement Learning algorithms for continuous control tasks with torch
* REINFORCE
* GPOMDP
* Stochastic Policy Gradient Theorem (SPG)
* Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem (DPG)
* DGP with Deep Learning (DDPG)
* Deep Continuous Q-Learning
